# Library_app
This repository has the solution for company's task which is library app service wrapped with docker.

# Quick start 
In order to run the app, you can run:
</br> docker-compose up 
</br> this command will create and process the needed image. 
</br> Then you can go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" and project should be run.

# Overview 
Django is a Python framework for developing Web applications. With Django, developers can quickly create object-relational database mappings, REST APIs, user front ends, and even administrative interfaces. Django implements a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern that separates the application's data (model) from its user interface (view) and business logic (controller), making it easy to write cleanly structured code.

</br>This template augments the existing power of Django by packaging your Django app into a Docker image, which can then be deployed onto AWS CodePipeline in a few simple steps. You can fork this repo into your own GitHub account and any changes you make to your Django application will automatically be updated via CodePipeline within minutes.

</br>This sample contains the following files:

* A sample Django API and data model, defined in the directory itemslist.
* The API and admin entry points for the Django app, defined in the directory itemsAPP.
* A wsgi.py file (in the itemsAPP directory) for running your Django application on your Docker image using WSGI.
* A Dockerfile that builds the Django application as a Docker image.
* A requirements.txt file that enables the Dockerfile to install Django and other dependencies via the pip command.
* A manage.py file for executing Django administrative tasks from the command line.
* A build.yml file for AWS CodeBuild that builds the image and pushes it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
* A AWS database was used.

# Application
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update & Delete. These are the four basic operations which are executed on Database Models. We are developing a web app which is capable of performing these operations.
</br>

## Models for Books

```
class Book(models.Model):
    # Store necessary fields
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 50)
    #picture = models.ImageField()
    author = models.CharField(max_length = 30, default='anonymous')
    year = models.IntegerField(('year'), max_length=4, choices=year_dropdown, default=datetime.datetime.now().year)

    #email = models.EmailField(blank = True)
    describe = models.TextField(default = 'DataFlair Django tutorials')
```
</br>
Django will make a table in a database named book. That table will have these fields:

Name, author, year, and description of the book object.

## Model Forms in Book
```
class BookCreate(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Book

        # Input from user
        fields = '__all__'
 ```
</br>
The BookCreate() class is the form class which represents the Model form. In the MetaClass, we define which model to be used to make the model form.

## View Functions for Django CRUD App
 ```
def index(request):
    shelf = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'book/library.html', {'shelf': shelf})

def upload(request):
    upload = BookCreate()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        upload = BookCreate(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if upload.is_valid():
            upload.save()
            return redirect('index')
        else:
            return HttpResponse("""your form is wrong, reload on <a href = "{{ url : 'index'}}">reload</a>""")
    else:
        return render(request, 'book/upload_form.html', {'upload_form':upload})

def update_book(request, book_id):
    book_id = int(book_id)
    try:
        book_sel = Book.objects.get(id = book_id)
    except Book.DoesNotExist:
        return redirect('index')
    book_form = BookCreate(request.POST or None, instance = book_sel)
    if book_form.is_valid():
       book_form.save()
       return redirect('index')
    return render(request, 'book/upload_form.html', {'upload_form':book_form})

def delete_book(request, book_id):
    book_id = int(book_id)
    try:
        book_sel = Book.objects.get(id = book_id)
    except Book.DoesNotExist:
        return redirect('index')
    book_sel.delete()
    return redirect('index')
 ```
* 1. Index Function : Read Operation. In this function, we simply retrieve all the objects in the book
* 2. Upload Function : CREATE operation of CRUD. It is simply taking form data from the user and saving it in a database
* 3. Update_book : If the object exists it will return the form filled with the objectâ€™s information in it. The user can change the form again. In this case, there will be no creation of new book but the editing of the existing book object.
* 4. Delete Function : Delete Function is the last function of the CRUD application. We are again using the same object method as with Update book function. We are passing the request and book_id to delete the book.

## Templates
* library.html : displaying objects from a database. We are running a for loop to access the data in the dictionary we passed.
* Upload_form.html : We are using csrf token and other form tags. 

## URLs

```
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name = 'index'),
    path('upload/', views.upload, name = 'upload-book'),
    path('update/<int:book_id>', views.update_book),
    path('delete/<int:book_id>', views.delete_book)
]
```
</br>URL lookups for library app as well as settings for Django static files. These settings are used by Django to render the images with the book object.

## DB
Database was used postgres from AWS, and django settings was connected successfully 
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME':'library',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'C3zLj9JuEv4Bf7PgplDA',
        'HOST': 'database-1.cwmdudwnngey.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```
